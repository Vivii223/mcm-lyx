<!-- This is a markdown table, if you are not familiar with it, just following my example is okay. -->
<!-- You can see https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables for more information if interested.  -->
<!-- Anyway, just using plain text is okay, too. By the way, Editing table in VS Code is very efficient, as it will format table automatically -->
